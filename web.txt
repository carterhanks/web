How does the internet work?:
    The internet is basically a network of servers and clients that communicate to each other via hardware and software. Its purpose is to connect people to the World Wide Web.

What happens when you click on a link?:
    Essentially, when you click on a link, your computer/internet browser break down the URL into separate sections. Upon doing so, it:
        -Searches the DNS to locate the IP address of the domain name
        -Sends an http request to that server asking to copy the contents of that website and send it back to the client
        -The server sends that information in packets back to the client upon approval
        -Reassembles those packets/chunks into data that can then be displayed on the client's screen
